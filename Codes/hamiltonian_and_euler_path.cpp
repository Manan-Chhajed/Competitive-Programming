/* 
  - Euler's path
    - Degree of a Vertex: In a graph, the degree of a vertex is defined as the number of edges incident to it.
    - The theorem states that if a graph has exactly two odd degree vertices, then it has exactly one Euler Path, but no Euler Circuit.
      Also the Euler Path must start at one of the odd vertices and end at another.

  - Euler's circuit
    - It states that if all the vertices of a graph component have an even degree (Excluding 0),
      then it must have an Euler's Circuit in it and Euler's Circuit can start and end at any vertex.
