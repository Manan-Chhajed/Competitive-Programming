  - Topological Sort for DAG i.e. directed acyclic sort

  - DFS approach --> https://cp-algorithms.com/graph/topological-sort.html
  - BFS approach --> Kahn's algo https://leetcode.com/problems/course-schedule-ii/submissions/1191319333
    - Cycle detection 
      - If topo sort has n vertices then no cycle, else cycle detected
