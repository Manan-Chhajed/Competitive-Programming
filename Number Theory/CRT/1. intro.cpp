Chineese Remainder Theorem

/* 
  Eg. Ques. x % 2 == 1
            x % 3 == 2
            x % 5 == 3
  then, what is x???
*/

/* 
  x % p1 == k1    (0 <= k1 < p1)
  x % p2 == k2
  .
  .
  x % pn == kn    (0 <= kn < pn)
  
  if p1, p2, p3.. pairwise are relatively prime
  
  x % p --> has only 1 soln.
  (p = p1 * p2 * ... * pn)
